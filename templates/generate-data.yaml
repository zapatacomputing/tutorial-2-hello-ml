# Every template YAML file must begin with a `spec`, without which your template won't compile.
spec:

  # The `templates` section is where you list one or more templates
  templates:

  # This is the name of the template, which is used to reference it in the workflow. This field is required.
  - name: generate-data

    # `generic-task` is the supertemplate that all templates (that don't contain a `steps` section) must inherit from
    parent: generic-task

    # This section is for the inputs needed to run the template. This section is required.

      # `parameters` represent initialization values for a template.

      - name: command
        value: python3 main.py

      # The `numsamples` parameter allows you to change the number of samples created in your workflow
      - name: time-range
        # This value acts as a default but can be overridden in the workflow
